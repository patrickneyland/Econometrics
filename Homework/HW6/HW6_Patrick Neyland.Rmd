## Question 1

end of recording in 
### Part i
$\theta$ is unbiased. Expected value of theta hat is equal to theta hat. 
theta hat is equal to beta hat 1 + beta hat 2
E(theta hat) = E(beta hat 1 +beta hat 2)
= E(beta hat 1) E(beta hat 2)
= beta 1 + beta 2 = theta

### Part ii
going from cov to corr
Define unbiasedness

### Part ii



## Question 2

The bias will be negative because I think avg ability will be positive and the correlation between variables is negative.
